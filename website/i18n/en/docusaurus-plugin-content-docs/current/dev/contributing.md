# Contributing Guide {#contributing}

Contributions of code, bug reports, and feature proposals are welcome!

## Local Development Environment {#local-development}

```bash
# Prerequisites: Python 3.12+, Node.js 20+, uv, pnpm, ffmpeg
# The documentation site website/ also needs Node 24 (pinned in website/.node-version)
# Operating system: Linux / MacOS / Windows WSL2 (native Windows is unsupported)

# Install dependencies
uv sync
cd frontend && pnpm install && cd ..

# Install the pre-commit hooks once (ruff / eslint / pull_request_target tripwire)
uv run pre-commit install

# Initialize the database
uv run alembic upgrade head

# Start the backend (terminal 1)
# Note: --reload-dir is required to limit the watched directories; otherwise watchfiles
# scans node_modules / .venv / .git / .worktrees and hundreds of thousands of files, costing 50%+ of one core
uv run uvicorn server.app:app --reload --reload-dir server --reload-dir lib --port 1241

# Start the frontend (terminal 2)
cd frontend && pnpm dev

# Open http://localhost:5173
```

### Documentation Site {#docs-site}

`website/` is a separate package root with its own lockfile and is not grouped into a workspace with frontend:

```bash
cd website && pnpm install

pnpm start        # Development preview
pnpm build        # Dual-locale build; a broken link or anchor fails outright
pnpm typecheck

# Site search only works against build output, not in the dev server
pnpm build && pnpm serve

# Sync the repo-root CONTRIBUTING.md into the docs-site page (start / build already run this automatically, so a manual run is rarely needed)
pnpm sync-contributing

# CI consistency gate: page inventory / orphan translations / docs-site headings missing an explicit anchor / UI JSON key completeness — a non-zero exit on any hit;
# it reads output already synced by sync-contributing, so run sync-contributing first
pnpm check-consistency
```

## Running Tests {#running-tests}

```bash
# Backend tests
python -m pytest

# Frontend typecheck + tests
cd frontend && pnpm check
```

## Code Quality {#code-quality}

**Lint & Format (ruff):**

```bash
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format .
```

- Rules: `E`/`F`/`I`/`UP`, with `E402` and `E501` ignored
- line-length: 120
- Enforced in CI: `ruff check . && ruff format --check .`

**Lint (frontend ESLint):**

```bash
cd frontend && pnpm lint          # Check
cd frontend && pnpm lint:fix      # Auto-fix what can be fixed
```

- Configuration: `frontend/eslint.config.js` (flat config)
- Rules: `typescript-eslint/recommendedTypeChecked` + `react/recommended` + `react-hooks/recommended` + `jsx-a11y/recommended`
- Typed linting enables `projectService: true`, allowing async-related checks such as `no-floating-promises` and `no-misused-promises`
- Enforced in CI: the `frontend-tests` job's `Lint` step

### ESLint disable conventions {#eslint-disable-policy}

The project has followed a zero-warning policy since PR 3 (#219); every rule is an error. If a rule must be bypassed, follow these conventions:

- **Form**: `// eslint-disable-next-line <rule> -- <中文理由>`; the reason after `--` is **required**
- **Forbidden**: file-level `/* eslint-disable */`, `// eslint-disable-line` without a reason, and combined use with `@ts-ignore`
- **PR description requirement**: every new disable must be listed in the PR body as a table with `rule | file:line | 理由`
- **File-level disabling** is allowed only through an `eslint.config.js` `files` override, with the reason documented in a config comment
- **Unacceptable reasons**: "too much trouble," "leave it like this for now," or "later fix"
- **Acceptable reason examples**: "React setter reference is stable," "mount-only initialization," or "generated preview video has no subtitle source"

**Local IDE recommendation (do not commit to the repository):**

`.vscode/` is already in `.gitignore`. Add `frontend/.vscode/settings.json` locally to make VS Code / Cursor show lint warnings in real time and apply automatic fixes when saving:

```json
{
  "eslint.workingDirectories": [{ "pattern": "./frontend" }],
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": { "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit" }
}
```

**Known constraint:**

- TypeScript version lock: the peer range of `typescript-eslint@8.x` is `typescript <6.1`; upgrade `typescript-eslint` before upgrading TypeScript to 6.1+

**Test coverage:**

- CI requires ≥80%
- `asyncio_mode = "auto"` (async tests do not need to be marked manually)

### Pytest marker discipline {#pytest-markers}

Every test case must have exactly one type marker. By default, CI runs `-m "not e2e"`:

| Marker | Meaning | Forbidden |
|--------|------|------|
| `unit` | Fast and isolated; does not touch real I/O or external services | — |
| `integration` | Cross-module collaboration using real dependencies (in-memory DB, temporary filesystem, and so on) | **Do not mock the public entry point of the module under test** (for example, an integration test for `MediaGenerator` must not mock `MediaGenerator.generate`, because that would test the mock itself) |
| `e2e` | End-to-end; depends on real external resources (remote APIs, LLM calls, heavyweight real ffmpeg work) | Skipped by default in CI; run locally when needed |

The marker can be applied at the test, class, or module (`pytestmark`) level. After combining all three levels, exactly one classification must still match.

Marker classification is enforced during pytest collection and does not depend on manual review:

- An unmarked or multiply marked test fails collection immediately (`tests/conftest.py::_enforce_classification_markers`), and the error lists the specific nodeid
- `--strict-markers` also makes markers not registered in `pyproject.toml` fail during collection

The existing `unit`/`integration` classifications came from bulk defaults (tests that invoke real ffmpeg to generate test audio or video assets, or that match `uses_db`, are classified as `integration`; all others as `unit`) and are not guaranteed to be semantically exact for every test. Classify new tests according to the table above—the use of real ffmpeg to generate a test fixture is different from the "heavyweight real ffmpeg work" in the `e2e` definition: the former invokes ffmpeg to produce test input, while the latter means a heavyweight ffmpeg processing pipeline in an end-to-end scenario.

## Documentation Maintenance {#docs-maintenance}

The only published location for user documentation is [docs.arc-reel.com](https://docs.arc-reel.com/en/); source files live in `website/docs/` (see "Documentation Site" above for local builds and previews). Chinese is the sole authoring source; English translations are generated by AI, and humans review only the Chinese source. Internal documentation (ADRs, `CONTEXT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, the security threat model, provider API documentation indexes, and so on) is not published on the site and remains under the repository's `docs/` directory. `SECURITY.md` also remains in the repository root because the GitHub Security tab depends on it.

This file is the source of truth for the contributing guide. During builds, it is copied to the site's development section (`website/scripts/sync-contributing.mjs`); the Chinese copy is not committed.

### Page responsibilities {#page-responsibilities}

| Page | Should contain | Should not contain |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | Product positioning, core value, and the shortest path to getting started | A complete model list, every environment variable, or internal implementation details |
| `website/docs/index.mdx` | Documentation-site positioning, primary entry points, and a navigation overview | Complete instructions for specific features |
| `website/docs/guide/getting-started.md` | The complete path from deployment to the first generated video | Production-grade reverse proxy and backup strategies |
| `website/docs/guide/workflows.md` | Content modes, video-making workflows, review checkpoints, and selection guidance | Provider credentials and operations commands |
| `website/docs/guide/providers.md` | Provider types, capability coverage, selection principles, and configuration hierarchy | Price promises likely to become outdated |
| `website/docs/guide/jianying-export.md` | Locating the Jianying draft directory, exporting, and further editing steps | The video generation process itself |
| `website/docs/guide/faq.md` | Frequently asked questions and short answers | Long tutorials |
| `website/docs/ops/deployment.md` | Deployment, upgrades, backup, recovery, monitoring, and security | Product marketing copy |
| `website/docs/ops/migrate-to-postgres.md` | SQLite-to-PostgreSQL migration, verification, and rollback steps | Day-to-day PostgreSQL deployment and operations guidance |
| `website/docs/dev/architecture.md` | Stable architectural boundaries, data flows, and extension points | Temporary implementation plans and incomplete designs |
| `SECURITY.md` | Supported versions, supported deployment boundaries, private vulnerability reporting, and coordinated disclosure policy | Details of unfixed vulnerabilities and dynamic risk registers |
| `docs/security/threat-model.md` | Security assets, trust boundaries, attack surfaces, existing controls, and reassessment triggers | Directly exploitable unfixed vulnerabilities and patch history |

### Writing conventions {#writing-conventions}

- **Keep the README stable**: the README only needs to help a first-time repository visitor answer, "What is ArcReel, is it right for me, how is it different from calling a model API directly, and what is the fastest way to run it?" Put specific model names, prices, and API parameters on the corresponding site pages so that the homepage does not need to be rewritten every time a provider changes.
- **Treat runtime capabilities as authoritative for provider information**: documentation describes the media types covered, how ArcReel unifies configuration, how to choose between different capabilities, and where to confirm specifics; the models actually selectable on the Settings page and the provider's official documentation are definitive.
- **Give headings explicit anchor IDs**: write every heading on a published page as `## 标题 {#english-id}`. The Chinese and English locales share the same anchor to prevent changes to copy from invalidating automatically generated Chinese slugs. Use relative file paths for cross-references within the site (such as `../ops/deployment.md`), and use absolute GitHub links when pointing to repository files not published on the site.
- **Commit documentation changes with feature changes**: when adding a content mode or video-making workflow, adding a provider or media capability, or changing deployment directories, ports, environment variables, data directories, backup methods, migration behavior, public APIs, licenses, or commercial-use terms, update the corresponding documentation at the same time.
- **No JSX or import in docs-site `.md` files**: `website/docusaurus.config.ts` sets `markdown.format: "detect"`, so `.md` files are parsed as CommonMark rather than MDX. Neither raises a compile error, and neither is executed as MDX: a JSX tag is output verbatim as raw HTML (a tag with children leaks that content directly onto the page), and an import statement is displayed verbatim as page text. Use `.mdx` for pages that need JSX.

## Workflow {#workflow}

### Branch strategy (trunk-based) {#branching-strategy}

- `main` is the only long-lived branch. Complete all work on short-lived branches created from the latest `main`, then merge them back into `main` through a PR
- Never push directly with `git push origin main`. Even personal branches use the PR workflow; review the diff and acceptance checklist yourself first

### Branch naming convention {#branch-naming}

Use `<type>/<slug>`, where `type` is one of the conventional commit types:

- `feat/` — New feature (for example, `feat/reference-video-backend`)
- `fix/` — Bug fix (for example, `fix/queue-lease-timeout`)
- `refactor/` — Refactoring (for example, `refactor/session-actor`)
- `docs/` — Documentation only (for example, `docs/contribution-infra`)
- `chore/` — Builds, tooling, version numbers, or cleanup (for example, `chore/freeze-versions`)
- `ci/` — CI configuration (for example, `ci/testing-discipline`)
- `test/` — Tests only

Use lowercase words separated by hyphens for `slug`, briefly describing the branch's focus.

### Short branch lifetime {#short-lived-branches}

The time from creation to merge must be ≤3 days. If it runs longer, split it or rebase it onto the main branch first—**do not** drag a one-month-old branch directly into review.

### Squash merge {#squash-merge}

Squash each PR into one commit when merging into `main`, with a conventional commit message (see the next section). Choose "Squash and merge" from the GitHub merge button.

## Commit Conventions {#commit-convention}

Commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
feat: 新增功能描述
fix: 修复问题描述
refactor: 重构描述
docs: 文档变更
chore: 构建/工具变更
```

## Release Process {#release-process}

Version numbers and the changelog are maintained automatically by [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) (configuration in `.release-please-config.json`, workflow in `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`). **Developers do not need to bump version numbers manually**—only write compliant conventional commits.

### Workflow {#release-workflow}

1. Squash-merge the PR into `main` according to the conventional commits specification
2. release-please scans commits since the previous release and automatically opens or updates a Release PR titled like `chore(main): release X.Y.Z`, containing the next version bump and an updated `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Merging that Release PR automatically creates a `vX.Y.Z` tag and publishes a GitHub Release

### commit type → version increment {#commit-type-version-bump}

| commit type | Version increment | changelog |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| `feat`      | minor   | ✨ 新功能 |
| `fix`       | patch   | 🐛 Bug 修复 |
| `feat!` / any type + `!` / footer containing `BREAKING CHANGE:` | **major** (minor when version <1.0.0) | ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES (at the top of the changelog) |
| `perf` / `refactor` / `docs` / `revert` | No increment | Shown (⚡ / ♻️ / 📚 / ↩️) |
| `chore` / `ci` / `build` / `test` / `style` | No increment | Hidden |

> By default, only `feat` and `fix` (as well as breaking changes) trigger a version bump in release-please. Configuring `perf`/`refactor`/`docs`/`revert` with `hidden: false` affects only their presentation in the changelog; it does not make them trigger a patch bump. If an iteration contains only these commit types, no Release PR is produced until the next `fix`/`feat` commit arrives.

The fields in `pyproject.toml` and `frontend/package.json` named `version` are maintained automatically by release-please (see the `pyproject.toml` comment `# managed by release-please`) and are **read-only for developers**. `uv.lock` is also synchronized automatically by running `uv lock` in the release-please workflow on the Release PR branch. The actual version state is defined by the git tag and `.release-please-manifest.json`.

### commit examples {#commit-examples}

**This repository does not use breaking-change markers.** The frontend and backend are released together, and the backend API does not make versioned compatibility guarantees—the bundled frontend evolves with each version, while external integrations (OpenClaw and others) fetch the latest contract at runtime through `/skill.md` rather than depending on a version number. When deleting or changing endpoints referenced by `public/skill.md.template`, update that template at the same time. Classify API changes normally as `fix`/`refactor`; do not add a `!` suffix or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. To correct an incorrectly marked commit after it has been merged, edit that PR's description and append a `BEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE`/`END_COMMIT_OVERRIDE` block. release-please then recalculates the changelog and version number according to the override (this requires squash merging, which this repository uses). The workflow runs only on pushes to main; after editing, wait for the next push to main or rerun the release-please workflow manually. During the 0.x stage, `bump-minor-pre-major` limits the version jump caused by an incorrect marker to minor, but does not correct the changelog.

The following syntax is documented only to help identify incorrect markers. There are two equivalent ways to mark a **breaking change**:

```
# Form 1: append ! after the type
feat(api)!: 移除 /api/v1/legacy 端点

# Form 2: a footer containing BREAKING CHANGE (more common; allows a multi-line description)
feat(auth): 统一 API Key 验证逻辑

BREAKING CHANGE: /api/v1/api-keys 的返回结构改为 { items: [...] }，
旧客户端需要适配。
```

In both forms, release-please will:
- Bump the version number to major; when the current version is <1.0.0, the `bump-minor-pre-major` configuration limits this to a minor bump
- Insert a separate **⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES** section at the top of the changelog, summarizing the description of each breaking change
- Keep the commit's regular entry under the corresponding type section (such as `✨ 新功能`)
