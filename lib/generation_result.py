"""Shared per-ID selection and result contract for every generation entry point.

Web and Agent adapters consume this module unchanged; it owns three things that
must not be re-derived per entry point:

* **Selection** — an explicit ID set or missing-only. Missing-only reads the
  Artifact Manifest and selects only ``missing``. ``stale`` stays usable, is
  reused rather than regenerated, and never blocks export; ``blocked`` fails
  loud as its own reported gap instead of triggering paid regeneration.
* **Result identity** — ``requested = succeeded ∪ failed ∪ blocked`` with the
  three sets mutually exclusive. Reused units are reported separately as
  ``skipped`` and are deliberately outside ``requested``.
* **Per-item problems** — a stable code, the artifact/unit ID, an
  agent-readable detail and a closed next action. No consumer parses free text
  to decide whether to retry.

Three status axes are reported separately and never collapsed: the queue task
state, the provider submission checkpoint, and the artifact's current/stale
standing. A succeeded task does not imply the artifact matches the current
basis.
